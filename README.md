## Before forking it this project...

I would like to remind everyone that the following code is under the CC-BY-NC license.
This means that I will allow forks that contribute to this bot or that lead to other bots **at the sole conditions** of:
- Attributing the work to me (`BY`)
- Not using it commercially (`NC`)

## How to use it?

Invite this bot to your server.
You can then get the list of commands by using r!help.

You can easily listen to the reactions in a message by copying the link to the said message then by sending:

`r!listen [Paste link here] [Emoji to listen to] [Mention of the role to give]`

You can also replace `[Paste link here]` with `[Channel ID] [Message ID]` and `[Mention of the role to give]` with `[ID of the role to give]`
